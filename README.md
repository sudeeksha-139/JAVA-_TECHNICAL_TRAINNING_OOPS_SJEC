💻 Technical Training on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Using Java

This repository contains the source code and exercises developed during my technical training on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java. The focus of this training was to build a solid understanding of OOP concepts along with practical implementation using Java and GUI development tools.


🌟 Skills & Concepts Covered

Throughout the training, I worked on various core and advanced Java topics, including:

🔹 Static Keyword – Applied to variables, methods, and classes

🔹 Constructors – Understanding default, parameterized, and copy constructors

🔹 Inheritance – Concept and use of method overriding for runtime polymorphism

🔹 Interfaces – Implementation of interfaces to support multiple inheritance

🔹 Abstract Classes – Exploring abstraction and its use in real-world scenarios

🔹 Swing Framework – Building basic GUI applications using Java Swing

🔹 Exception Handling – Using try-catch, throws, and custom exception classes

🔹 Multithreading – Managing thread lifecycle and concurrency

🔹 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – Connecting Java applications to databases using SQLite



🗄️ Database Integration (JDBC with SQLite)

For all JDBC-related operations, SQLite was used as the database.

> ✅ Ensure the appropriate SQLite JDBC driver is added to your project's classpath to enable connectivity and database interaction.



🛠️ Visual Studio Code Configuration

To enable smooth Java development in VS Code, this project includes a configuration file:

.vscode/settings.json

This file helps manage:

✅ Java project source path

✅ Compiler settings and code formatting rules
